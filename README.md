<p>This project is to create a simple airline management system using the C programming language. The system allows users to manage flights and reservations.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with the project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/guylaiter/AirLineManagmentSystem.git</code></pre>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To build and run the project, you must have a C compiler installed on your machine. The project has been tested with GCC on Linux and MinGW on Windows.</p>

<h2>Building and Running the Project</h2>
<p>To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>gcc main.c Airline.c Airport.c AirportManager.c General.c Flight.c FlightManager.c Date.c GeneralList.c Plane.c -o airline_mgmt_sys</code></pre>
<p>This command compiles the main.c, Airline.c, Airport.c, AirportManager.c, General.c, Flight.c, FlightManager.c, Date.c, GeneralList.c, and Plane.c files and links them into an executable file called airline_mgmt_sys.</p>

<p>Make sure to run this command in the directory where all the source files are located.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once the program is running, you will be presented with a menu that allows you to manage and search flights. Follow the on-screen instructions to add, modify, or delete flights.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Contributions to the project are welcome. To contribute, fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes. Once you have made your changes, submit a pull request.</p>
